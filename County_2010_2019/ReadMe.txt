CATI 1.0 Public Use Variable Information

This file contains data used to construct county values of the Child and Adolescent Thriving Index 1.0. 

More information on original data sources and how the index is constructed is available at https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S0749-3797(23)00280-5. Readers interested in how the methodology was derived can find more information at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-022-09962-0.

Each row represents a single area-year combination (year and fipscode variables). The file is parsed down to focus on the index components themselves, and does not contain the imputations for areas with missing data.
